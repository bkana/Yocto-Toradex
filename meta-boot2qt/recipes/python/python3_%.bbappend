# We need to install the python3 binary into the sysroot to let qtivi install that binary
# into the correct location.
# We can't install it directly into ${bindir} as this would be picked up by other recipes
# and produce a lot of errors. Instead put it inside a qt5 folder where only qtivi picks it up
# This is a workaround and needs to be replaced by a proper solution discussed here:
